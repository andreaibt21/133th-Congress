# 133th-Congress


In this project I was able to impruve my JavaScript skills and learn Vue.Js and Bootstrap. 

First I did the whole project with JS then I had to update it and change it to Vue.Js 

I had to acces the ProPublica Api to have the 133th Congress members and display them in tables with filters by state and party with live data.

There are 2 versions the Task 3 is with JS and Task 4 is with Vue.Js

Task 3: https://andreaibt21.github.io/133th-Congress/Task%203/index.html

Task 4: https://andreaibt21.github.io/133th-Congress/Task%204/index.html
